# libft

My own Lib C functions. The goal of this project is to understand better how basic functions of a low-level programming language work. The task is to recreate various standard C library functions, as well as extra things which might be useful, like linked lists for example.

# Compiling

You may compile libft.a by running make.

# Usage

Include it in your C project:
#include "libft.h"
