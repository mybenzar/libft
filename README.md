# libft
My own Lib C functions. This project allowed me to understand better how basic functions of a low-level programming language work. 

libft @ 42
This is the first 42 project. The task is to recreate various standard C library functions, as well as extra things which might be useful, like linked lists for example.

Compiling
You may compile libft.a by running make.

Usage
Include it in your C project:

#include "libft.h"
